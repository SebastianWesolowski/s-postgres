## ðŸŽ¯ Development and Setup

To get started with this boilerplate, follow these steps:

1. Install the dependencies:

```bash
yarn install
```

2. Run the update with s-update-manager:

```bash
yarn s-update-manager
```

3. Set up your repository

Replace variables in the `./tools/customize/customize.config.ts` script with your own details to personalize your new package:

```bash
export const config: CustomizeConfig = {
  replacements: [
    {
      placeholder: "{{PLACEHOLDER_FULL_NAME_EXAMPLE}}",
      value: "Sebastian Wesolowski",
      files: [
        "package.json",
        "README.md",
        "./docs/HowToAutoDeploy.md",
        ".github/FUNDING.yml",
      ],
    },
    {
      placeholder: "{{PLACEHOLDER_PAGE_AUTHOR_EXAMPLE}}",
      value: "www.wesolowski.dev",
      files: [".github/FUNDING.yml", "package.json", "LICENSE"],
    },
    ...
```

You can look at an example in `./tools/customize/customize.example.config.ts`

Run script with:

```bash
yarn customize
```

or

```bash
tsx tools/customize/customize.ts
```

4. Optional

- 4.1. Add ngrok token in .env file for local development

  ```bash
   NGROK_AUTH_TOKEN=your_ngrok_token
  ```

  After that, you can run ngrok to expose your local server to the internet:

  ```bash
    yarn dev:tunnel
  ```

5. Run the development server:

```bash
yarn dev
```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

7. Check local preview package

Just use `yarn dev:build` and look at the build version on local environment.

## Deployment Workflow

### Pre-release

Pre-release is prepared from feature and dev branches.

### Pre-production

Pre-production should be created with a pull request to the main branch.

### Release

Release is created on the main branch and prepared by GitHub Actions.
